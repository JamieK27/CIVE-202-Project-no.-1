For CIVE 202, we are to recreate reports, code, etc. as if we are completing an RFP. The client in this project is UNMC, a climate and health group, and would like me to analyze and answer questions about air quality in Nebraska. 

The goal of this project is to analyze air quality data provided by AirPurple for a request for proposal from UNMC. The client has requested four key analyses: (1) determine 5 locations in Nebraska with the highest mean and median concentrations of VOC, PM 2.5, and PM 10.0, (2) determine what days maximum values occurred and the location, (3) determine the relation of air quality, humidity, and temperature, and (4) review data for any Air Quality Index health risks for PM 2.5 and PM 10.0. 

In doing so, I will learn python function, how to write a SOW, extract and load data, how to compute statitics, and organize data.
